2. Bottle necks
    a. A single thread to read from the file is a inefficient. As a preprocess, the file can be prettified such that
    the line count for each JSON object is fixed. Now that the line numbers of each JSON object are known, more number
    of threads can be used to read from the file.

    b. QueryResult and BlockingQueue can be lock free.

    c. Parsing JSON strings to JSON objects is another bottleneck. A seperate thread pools can be created for
    JSON parsing and query computations. This way, query computations need not wait for JSON parsing which can improve
    the performance of the overall script.
