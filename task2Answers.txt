1. Used one thread to read JSON strings from the file and three threads to process JSON strings for given queries.
2. Implemented BlockingQueue which limits the queue size to support large files(much greater than 1GB).
Limiting the queue size to 100000 is utilising around 1.2GB of RAM.
3. Implemented thread safe QueryResult to calculate the query results using only one scan of data.
